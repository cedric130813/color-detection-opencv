### Colour detection with openCV ðŸ“·
Tools used: openCV (python)
- This is another openCV project which I'm testing out to detect colour(s) (converting BGR to HSV - [refer to this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17063042/why-do-we-convert-from-rgb-to-hsv)), which in this case is red colour. 
- The idea behind this is to create lower and upper boundaries for the red colour for the "mask" which will match with the image

Demo: (Detecting a red t-shirt)
